**"Project Name: Chapter2_Challenge_Applet"**



**Critical Analysis:**

**1. Security (Sandbox Model):**
The Java Applet sandbox restricts applets to ensure security. Two things an applet would NOT be allowed to do on a user's computer:
- Access the local file system: Applets cannot read or write files (e.g., config.txt) to prevent unauthorized data access.
- Execute system commands: Applets cannot run arbitrary system commands (e.g., launching executables) to avoid malicious actions.

**2. Modern Replacement:**
Java Applets have been replaced by HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These technologies provide dynamic, interactive web content without the security risks and plugin requirements of applets. Example of a bouncing text animation:
- HTML: Define a <div> for the text.
- CSS: Style the text and use absolute positioning.
- JavaScript: Use setInterval() to update the text's position and reset it when it hits the edge.


**3. Legacy:**
Understanding applets is important for developers because:
- Historical Context: Applets were a key part of early web interactivity, and legacy systems may still use them, requiring maintenance.
- Security Lessons: The applet sandbox model informs modern security practices in web development (e.g., browser sandboxes).
- Migration: Developers may need to port applet-based applications to modern technologies like JavaScript or WebAssembly.

Setup Instructions:
1. Ensure JDK 8 or higher is installed.
2. Compile: `javac BouncingTextApplet.java`
3. Run with appletviewer: `appletviewer applet.html`
4. The applet displays the name "Efrata Zewdu" bouncing horizontally on a black background.

Notes:
- The applet uses deprecated API, as expected, but functions correctly in appletviewer.
- The code avoids modern frameworks to focus on core applet functionality.
